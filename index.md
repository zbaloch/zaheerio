Hi there. My name is Zaheer Baloch.

I’m  a Pakistani maker-of-software currently living in Bahrain with a passion for software design and development.

During the past 13+ years I’ve worked as a software engineer and architect with many different enterprise software projects.

I currently work at American Express (Middle East) making a difference in our customer’s live in ways that matter most to them.
