NewsBlur (YC S12) | Remote Android Engineer | Remote | Part Time
I'm looking for an Android developer to help build the next version of the NewsBlur Android app. NewsBlur is a popular RSS news reader with apps on the web, iOS, and Android as well as a thriving third-party developer scene and integration into over a dozen news readers.

Are you or somebody you know looking for a part time Android development gig that gives you schedule and feature autonomy? The next version of the NewsBlur Android app is ready to be built and I'm looking for somebody excited to work on a popular news reader to join the team.

My budget is $2-3k / month and there's plenty of great features to build. You can inspect the code base right now and see if you're a good fit: https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur (check clients/Android for the Java source).

Email me at samuel@newsblur.com. We can start immediately!
